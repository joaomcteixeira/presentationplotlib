# presentationplotlib

This is an experimental project of me using matplotlib to create PDF based presentations.

If you want real PPT presentations please see the [python-pptx](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). But, because all my presentations are PDF based, I want to find my way with matplotlib :-)
